# Prediction-of-wine-quality
This project is about the prediction of red wine quality using different machine learning algorithms.
For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not.

Steps included in this project:

Importing Lib
Loading Data
Understanding Data
Missing Values
Exploring Variables(Data Anylasis)
Feature Selection
Proportion of Good vs Bad Wines
Preparing Data for Modelling
Applying different models
Choosing right model
